gradually growing for the need of more thorough cyber security. The long term
is that this will be a much-needed field because cyber security and ethical
hacking will be needed to prevent and stop cyber-attacks and hacking in the
future. My company will be praised to take advantage by keeping a well-developed
research team and a monitoring team that can provide the ethical hacking

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Digital Shield
offers both a product and a service depending on the level in which you would
like to buy. Our first subscription plan named Cyber Shield. will be just the
anti-theft/cyber security protection software. This includes your basics of a
firewall, VPN, cite prevention, a secure cloud storage. These all are a part of
our lowest price option that we will offer at 15$ a month or for 100$ a year
depending on your preferred mode of payment. This also includes free updates
and troubleshooting if a problem were to be recognized. Our second level named
Cyber Armor is a little bit more advanced that includes all aspects of the
first but with added features of dark web monitoring and privacy monitoring
system. This will be offered at 20$ a month or at 120$ a year. Lastly the final
product/service named cyber suit which is the best to offer with best
protection. This includes all features above plus a service were up to 3 times
a year a Digital Shield cyber security ethical hacker service can be offered.
With this the associate will have to be in contact with the company and have
arranged dates set aside to evaluate the cyber security of the client. With
this service you will be able to provide feedback on employee behavior. With
that you can have that adjusted so that people may not use your own staff
against you to get into your system. The plan itself cost 300$ a month or about
3000$ a year for this service. If needed you can request an ethical hacker more
than the designated 3 times a year for an additional 300$ a visit.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>If you go and read
up on our competitions services, you get protection form cyber threats just
like ours, but we offer the edge in providing ethical hacking where others do
not. By us having that service alone we have an advantage for consumers to be
safer and business not having to worry about their hard-earned assets being in
jeopardy. Compared to the competition we are the one that offers a plan
directly for business and that is the plan named Digital Suit. This one is
tailor made for business because of the ethical hacker function. From research
I have put together ethical hacking is usually a freelancer type of business
not offered in a subscription or list of products. We also offer the advantage
of being a third party, so you do not have to worry about someone being under
your pay scale has an ethical hacker. We provide the service, and you just must
handle the bill rather than a full salary employee. In all our services help
provide a necessity in todays world were the cyber realm needs a shield and we
are here to provide that defense.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.5in;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Our disadvantages
are that we have an idea we must just offer the service and product. We are
still in development, so we have many strides to take before we are ready as a
company to launch. Also because of we offer our prices are high but with time
that disadvantage will become small or mute because of our advancement to make
the cost cheaper.        </span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>The idea of
ethical hacking and security measure is nothing new for the market but how we
implement the idea is new. We plan to implement our measures through local
means and be in person software security.  From my research there is no patents
that are in place for my idea for a business. It is also difficult to put a
patent on my service. A general service that is in common use for network
security is hard to patent. Other forms of legal protection would be looked
upon like a Trade Secret and Copywrite. Since I have a software program that
goes along with my service that works as a network security that works in the
background when I am not there. I would use a trade secret to help protect my
software design for two reasons. The first being my clients safety because if
the person who is trying to do harm knows the code they could search for weak
points and try to exploit them. This can be bad for business and reputation of
my company. Second being it protects the product that I am selling from other
businesses. This is so they do not get the leg up on our competitive edge. I
will also be seeking a trademark for my logo so no one else can use it for their

conversation with the client and get ideas and criticisms from the customer
directly. It will typically take place throughout the whole session of the pen
testing, so it feels like a place where the customer has a voice in how the
company runs.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:28.35pt;line-height:normal'><span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Our testing
structures were specifically chosen to help save money on development while
getting the most data that we can. For example, our survey and census can be
very cost effective and give us information about our target market that we
would not have thought of. It could reveal that we are more into other markets
than other such as age or income. The other two are more costly and require
more effort but will provide more crucial information that the survey cannot.
We will get more structured information alongside more detailed information
from our focus groups and casual interviews.<br>
            At first, we will start with the focus groups and surveys. This is
so we can a more concrete view of our market. Our surveys will go out first
over social media and You Tube to get the market data and after that we use
that data to make the focus groups to get more detailed information about our
markets needs and wants. The causal interviews will specifically be with
ethical hacking only so they will provide a one-on-one experience with the
customer and be the last market testing deployed mainly because it is better
for the B2B side of the business.</span></p>

style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>Our Products
distribution will mainly be online except for the ethical hacker program which
is based on location and direct sales. We have three programs that we sell and
their price according to what they offer. Our lowest option is Cyber Shield at
$15 dollars a month or $100 a dollar a year. This includes the basics like VPN,
Firewall, and secure cloud storage. This is justifiable to pay minimum price
for maximum protection. Our second plan includes everything the first offers
plus dark web monitoring and privacy monitoring. The price is at $20 a month or
$120 dollars a year. This is justifiable because of the extra features and
competitive price with other competitors like Norton with an equal value plan
at $29.99 year for the first year and $124.99 there on after. (Norton,2021) In
the short run yes, it is more expensive to go with us but in the long run we
are cheaper and offer better service.</span></p>

a sq ft a month so that will come out $665 a month. (</span>LoopNet.com,2021<span
style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif'>) This will take
into effect once staffing becomes needed. Now it will just be me working on the
coding. For utilities for a space of this size which includes water, electric,
garbage and heating will be around 159.19 a month in Arizona. These two prices
will be ongoing for the time being. The current business will start off at home
with my self being the only employee. </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;line-height:normal'><span

just require a desk chair and computer set up this will cost around 1599.99 for
all-in-one desk top computer by HP, the desk itself would cost 76.49 off
amazon, and lastly a chair would be about 109.99 from amazon. Once these are
bought it is a one-time thing unless repairs are needed.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;line-height:normal'><span

directory to all our products and the main source of our revenue. All ads
related to digital shield will bring them to this site, so it needs to be
crucial in its design. This will be our main way of distribution of our
products. This is so we can keep cost low and provide to the most amount of
people. These prices will not take effect until a month before launch.  </span></p>

get the capital to build my products and sustain the business will be done
through multiple ways.  Loans and investors will be the main avenues for
gaining funding.  I mainly will seek an investor and be willing to give up a
portion of the company. I will only accept an investor that can not only hold
monetary value but also help in insight of the program development. We will be
needing $400,000 in investments so that we can operate in our first year. There
will also be the need to boost the development so that we can build the
project.</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-indent:.25in;line-height:normal'><span

start at a lost. Once the project gets up and running it will take time because
the word needs to get out through social media. It has a response rate that is
just under a percent for both YouTube and Facebook. This will be about an
average of the year 3 when we will be more profitable. </span></p>
